;;; Commentary: 
;; This defines a new minor mode which highlights the symbol under 
;; point in the current buffer.  You must pause briefly in order to 
;; see the effect.  The highlight is removed when you take any action. 
;; ToDo: 
;; - should use defcustom 
;; - don't do anything when in string syntax - ? 
;;   also perhaps not in comment syntax?
